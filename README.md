# NextAuth with getServerSideProps - Intermittent Authentication Failures in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using NextAuth.js with `getServerSideProps` in Next.js 15.  Intermittently, the authentication check within `getServerSideProps` fails, resulting in unexpected behavior, such as the inability to access protected routes even when logged in.

## Bug Description

The issue seems to be related to the timing of the authentication check and the availability of the session data within `getServerSideProps`. In some instances, `unstable_getServerSession` returns `null` even when the user is actively logged in, leading to an unauthenticated state despite a valid session.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about` after logging in.  Observe the inconsistent authentication status.

## Potential Causes

* **Timing Issues:** Asynchronous operations within `getServerSideProps` may interfere with the session retrieval, leading to race conditions.
* **NextAuth Configuration:**  An issue with the NextAuth configuration itself might be causing the intermittent failures.
* **Caching:** Potential caching issues could cause stale session data.

## Workaround (In aboutSolution.js)

The provided solution utilizes a more robust approach to session handling, ensuring consistent authentication checks and addressing potential race conditions.
